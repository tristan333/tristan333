# Hi, I'm Tristan 👋

**Data Analyst @ Chronograph | Building at the intersection of technology, geopolitics, and private capital markets**

I work with data systems and API integrations for institutional investors, helping some of the world's largest private equity firms monitor their portfolios. Outside of work, I build tools to track and analyze semiconductor policy, export controls, and the evolving tech competition between major powers.

## 🔨 What I'm Working On

**Current Projects:**
- 🌍 **[Semiconductor News Aggregator](https://github.com/tristan333/news-aggregator)** - Real-time intelligence terminal tracking chip technology and US-China relations ([Live Demo](https://news-aggregator-ru4n.onrender.com/))
- 🤖 **Sentiment Analysis Engine** - Machine learning project analyzing export control policy and US foreign economic policy rhetoric
- 📊 **Internal Dashboards** - Building data monitoring and integrity tools using SQL and GraphQL at Chronograph

**Skills I'm Developing:**
Python • API Integration • Web Development • Automation • Machine Learning • SQL/GraphQL • Data Pipelines

## 🌐 What I Care About

I'm fascinated by how technology reshapes power dynamics between nations. My focus areas include:

- **Semiconductor Geopolitics** - Export controls, supply chain security, and the race for chip supremacy
- **US-China Relations** - Technology competition, trade policy, and strategic decoupling
- **Technology & Democracy** - How digital tools can strengthen or undermine democratic institutions (particularly interested in European politics as a German national)
- **Private Capital Markets** - Data infrastructure, portfolio monitoring, and institutional investment technology

## 📚 Background

I'm always interested in:
- Collaborating on projects at the intersection of tech and international relations
- Discussing semiconductor policy, export controls, and tech geopolitics
- Building tools that make complex data more accessible
- General networking with people working on interesting problems
